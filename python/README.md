Here are my experiments with python:
- pyMetis: Using the metis library in python to find the fill-in reducing order of a matrix.
- partial-coloring: A heuristic coloring specifically for matrices with partial important nonzero elements.
- TF: First experiments with tensor flow
- Non-Homomorphism: Some experimental approaches for computing non homomorphism in graphs
